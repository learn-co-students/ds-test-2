## Calculus, Cost Function, and Gradient Descent

| **Question Number** | **Question** | **Learning Goal** | **Point Value** |
| :-----------------: | :----------: | :---------------: | :-------------: |
| 1 | What is a more generalized name for the RSS curve up above? | Describe a cost curve and what it means to move along it | 1 |
| 2A | Would you rather choose a *m* value of 0.08 or 0.03 from the curve up above? | Describe a cost curve and what it means to move along it | 1 |
| 2B | Explain what it means to move along the curve in relation to the best fit line with respect to the $m$ value you chose in 2A | Describe a cost curve and what it means to move along it | 2 |
| 3 | Using the gradient descent visual from above, explain why the distance between steps is getting smaller | Define step sizes in the context of gradient descent | 1 |
| 4 | Explain how a very small and a very large learning rate would affect the gradient descent. | Define step sizes in the context of gradient descent | 1 |
